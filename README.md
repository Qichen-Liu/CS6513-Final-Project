# Abstract:
In the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global economic activities and
people's daily lives. New York City, the most economically developed region in the world, also experienced 
unprecedented changes in economic and employment activities. In this project, we aim to leverage big data technology 
to analyze the impact of the pandemic on business and employment in different industries in New York City. We have 
collected and processed abundant data from NYC official open sources and other government sources. We also identified 
relevant variables and performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into how the pandemic has affected different 
industries in the city. We developed and tested our hypotheses using statistical analysis and deliver our findings 
through visualizations, reports, and presentations. Our analysis reveals that the majority of industries in New York 
City were negatively impacted by the pandemic. However, we also observed a few industries that were more resilient and 
even experienced growth during this period. Our results will provide insights to analyze the economic resistance to a 
long-lasting global pandemic in a highly economically developed city like New York City.
